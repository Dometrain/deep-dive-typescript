# Linting TypeScript

In JavaScript, linting is a way to analyze code for potential errors and enforce coding standards. There are a variety of linting rules that can be used to catch common mistakes and enforce best practices.

I recommend using ESLint for linting TypeScript code. ESLint is a popular linting tool that can be used to analyze JavaScript and TypeScript code. It has a large number of built-in rules and can be extended with custom rules.

For TypeScript, consider these ESLint plugins:

- https://typescript-eslint.io/. There are dozens of rules, and a set of recommended rules. I suggest using the recommended rules as a starting point and then add or remove rules as needed.
