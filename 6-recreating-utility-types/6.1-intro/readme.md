# Recreating utility types

I have a theory: A great way to truly learn advanced TypeScript is to implement a few of TypeScript's built-in utility types. So in this module, we'll create our own implementation of a few of the utility types that we learned in a previous section.

So think of this module as practice for many of the new concepts we've learned so far related to generics, mapped types and modifiers, conditional types, and more. At the end of this module, you'll understand how TypeScript's utility types work under the hood.

Of course, throughout this module, you can cheat by looking at the TypeScript source code. But I encourage you to try to implement these utility types yourself first, and then I'll walk through TypeScript's implementation so you can practice reading mapped types, and understand TypeScript's built-in types work.

And I'll close out the module with a short challenge to create a new utility type that expands the functionality of a built-in utility type. So let's get started!
