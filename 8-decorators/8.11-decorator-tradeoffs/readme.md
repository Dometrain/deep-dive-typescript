# Why Not Decorators?

- Not stable yet (stage 3)
- Generate a lot of code
- Can be hard to type
- Must use classes to use decorators (in functional paradigms, would just use function composition)
- Can make it harder to understand the program's flow - may introduce side effects and dependencies that are not immediately visible.
- Can make it harder to read, test, and debug code, as they can obscure the original structure and behavior of the decorated values.
- Can lead to performance issues, as decorators add overhead
