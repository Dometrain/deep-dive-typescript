# Recreating utility types

I have a theory - the best way to truly understand what we've covered so far is to practice.

And a great way to practice is to implement a few of TypeScript's built-in utility types. So, in this module, we'll create our own implementation of a few of the utility types that we used earlier in the course.

Along the way, we'll practice the new concepts we've learned including generics, mapped types, modifiers, conditional types, and more. At the end of this module, you'll understand how TypeScript's built-in utility types work.

So, here's the plan: I'll propose an exercise where you try to implement a utility type first. Then I'll walk through TypeScript's implementation so you can see how to read existing types, and understand how TypeScript's built-in types work.
