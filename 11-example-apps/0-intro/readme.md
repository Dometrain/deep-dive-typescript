# Example Apps Intro

In this module, we'll briefly review a few example TypeScript web apps so I can demonstrate the concepts we've covered in the course. These examples should help you understand how to apply TypeScript in real-world scenarios with a few different tech stacks.

We'll review a simple JS app, a Bun SPA, and a React and Node TypeScript monorepo app with shared types.
