# Utility Types Intro

Sometimes you want to create a new type from an existing type. In these cases, consider using utility types.

In "TypeScript: Getting Started", we used our first utility type, `Record`. Record creates a type for storing key value pairs, also known as a dictionary. But TypeScript provides several other utility types that help you manipulate types. They are generic types that take one or more type arguments and return a new type.

We'll explore generics in detail later in the course, but for now all you need to understand is a generic type is a type that accepts one or more types as arguments.
