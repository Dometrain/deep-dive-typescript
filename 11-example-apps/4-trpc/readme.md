## TypeScript monorepo

If you're considering using TypeScript on both your backend and your frontend, consider using tRPC.

tRPC allows you to create type-safe APIs using TypeScript. You can define your API endpoints and their types in one spot, and share the types between your client and server code. tRPC is like using an SDK for your API's server code - each call has full type safety. It also integrates with Zod for schema validation.
