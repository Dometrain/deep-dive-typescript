# What You'll Learn

In this course, we'll cover some of TypeScript's most powerful and useful features.

I'll share over a dozen different ways to safely narrow types, and how to choose between them.

We'll explore generics, which will allow us to write code that works with many different types while still maintaining type safety.

We'll use TypeScript's built-in utility types to generate new types, and explore how they're written to help us understand how we can create our own utilities.

We'll create new types from existing types using advanced features like mapped types, string literal types, conditional types, and more.

TypeScript doesn't exist at compile time, so we'll explore how to use Zod to validate our data at runtime, and how to use it to infer your TypeScript types so you can enjoy both compile-time and runtime safety.

And we'll use other advanced features like decorators, template literal types, and more.

We'll also explore using TypeScript in the real world by reviewing a fullstack TypeScript app that uses Node, Express, and React, and shares types between the frontend and backend.

Finally, I'll close out the course with recommended next steps including TypeScript performance and debugging tips, key third-party libraries, and resources for practices your newfound skills.
