// Exercise: Branded Types in TypeScript

// Question 1:
// Create a branded type `Username` that is a string.

// Question 2:
// Create two functions:
// 1. `assertUsername` - An assertion function that accepts a string and assures it's
// a valid `Username` that is at least 3 characters long.
// 2. `toUsername` - A type predicate that calls `assertUsername`, then converts a string to a `Username`
// via a type assertion.

// Question 3:
// Create a function called logUsername that accepts a Username and logs it to the console.
// Call the `toUsername` function created in Question 2 to safely convert a string to a Username.
