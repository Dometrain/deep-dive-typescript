# Example Apps Intro

JavaScript started in the browser. So many TypeScript ultimately run in the browser.

In this module, we'll briefly review a few example TypeScript web apps.

Why? Two goals:

1. I want to show some tips for interacting with the DOM via TypeScript.
2. I want to demonstrate some of the concepts we've covered in the course in an app setting.

These examples should help you understand how to apply TypeScript in common scenarios with a few different tech stacks.

We'll review 3 simple demo apps:

1. A simple web page that runs some TypeScript compiled to JS
2. A SPA that runs via Bun
3. A TypeScript monorepo that uses Node on the backend and VanillaJS on the frontend.
4. And finally, a React frontend that uses a library called trpc to communicate with a Node backend.
