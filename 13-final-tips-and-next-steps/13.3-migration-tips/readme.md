# Migration tips

- Consider enabling allowJs in your tsconfig.json to allow TypeScript to type check JavaScript files. This is useful for gradually migrating a codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript. This allows you to start using TypeScript features in your JavaScript files without having to convert everything at once.

- Consider [ts-migrate](https://github.com/airbnb/ts-migrate).
