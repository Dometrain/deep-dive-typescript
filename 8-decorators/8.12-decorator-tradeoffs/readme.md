# Why Not Decorators?

- Not stable yet (stage 3)
- Generate a lot of code
- Can be tricky to type properly
- Must use a class (in functional paradigms, would just use function composition)
- Can make it harder to understand the program's flow - may introduce side effects and dependencies that are not immediately visible.
- Can make it harder to read, test, and debug code, as they can obscure the original structure and behavior of the decorated values.
- Can lead to performance issues if overused, as decorators add overhead on every call to the decorated value.
