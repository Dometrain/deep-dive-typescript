Welcome to TypeScript: Deep Dive. I'm Cory House. As an independent consultant, I've helped many companies successfully transition from JavaScript to TypeScript.

This is an advanced course, but to save you time, I'm deliberately being picky about what I'm covering in this course. I'm not trying to cover every corner of TypeScript.
