// Exercise: Branded Types in TypeScript

// Question 1:
// Create a branded type for a UserId that is a string but cannot be confused with a regular string.

// Question 2:
// Uncomment the `User` type below, then write a function `getUserById` that accepts the `UserId` type created in question 1,
// and returns a user with the given userId. Set the user's `name` property to "John".
// Then, invoke the function with a UserId and log the result.

// type User = {
//   id: UserId;
//   name: string;
// };

// Question 3:
// Create a branded type for a Meter that is a number but cannot be confused with a regular number.

// Question 4:
// Write a function `convertMetersToCentimeters` that accepts a Meter and returns the equivalent value in centimeters, as a number.
