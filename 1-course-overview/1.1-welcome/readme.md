# Welcome

Welcome to TypeScript: Deep Dive. I'm Cory House. As an independent consultant, I've helped many companies successfully transition from JavaScript to TypeScript.

This is an advanced course, but to save you time, I'm deliberately being picky about what we're covering. Sure, we'll explore most of TypeScript's advanced features, but, I'm not trying to cover every corner of TypeScript. We're going to explore the advanced features, patterns, and related libaries that I believe you'll find most useful on a daily basis.
